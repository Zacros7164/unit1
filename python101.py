# variables
# - strings, letters, numbers, or any other stuff
# you can make with a keyboard

# variables do not make a program faster.
# they make the program slower.
# variables make it easier for us to write a program.

# This is how you declare a variable

# Data types
# - Programming languages see different types of varibles differently
# - string = English stuff.
# - Number = something with a number or a - or e for standard notation.
#     - floats = decimal point in the number
#     - integers = whole number (no decimal point)
# - Booleans = true or false, on or off, 1 or 0
# - list = a bunch of things in one variable, most other languages call this an array
# - Dictionaries = a variable of variables
# - Objects - super dictionaries 

# Primitvie Data types = String, Numbers, Booleans (like base elements hydrogen, oxygen, etc)
# Abstract data types = List, Dictionaries, Objects (things made up of primitive dtata types, like H2O OR NaCl)
